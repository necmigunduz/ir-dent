# Book List App
This project is developed as a takehome project. It is a basic library application. This project has two sides: 'dent-api' and 'client'. 'dent-api' is the back-end Api where the information of books are stored. 'client' has a form enabling users to make new book entries and a books-display-screen.

## Getting Started
* Prepare back-end for operation:

- `cd ir-dent/dent-api`,
- `npm install`.

* To run the back-end application:

- `service mongod start`,
- `npm start`.

## Usage
- When the application is active, a form and books recorded in the app will be displayed on the screen. To make a new book entry, a user is required to fill all input fields and select a category. Otherwise, recording process will end up with a failure. The front-end uses `http://localhost:3000` and the back-end uses `http://localhost:5000`. To view the recorded books in the back-end, a user needs to visit `http://localhost:5000/books`.
